# Welcome to Wannier90 documentation repository!

Feel free to make pull requests here

This repository is a test to see if we can convert the documentation to GitHub pages easily

THIS IS NOT YET THE DOCUMENTATION OF WANNIER90, but just a working place to see if we can easily convert the documentation to GitHub pages/Jekyll and all features are still supported.

# How to see the compiled docs
Visit http://wannier-developers.github.io/wannier90-docs
